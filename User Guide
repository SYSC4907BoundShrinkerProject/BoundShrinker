To use the bound shrinking software follow these steps:
1. Download the files "BoundShrinker.jl" and "model.jl" from the repository and place them inside the same folder.
2. Launch the Julia language program.
3. Type â€œcd("file_path")" into Julia and hit enter where file path is the file path to the folder containing the 
"BoundShrinker.jl" and "model.jl" files.
4. Type "include("BoundShrinker.jl")" and hit enter.
5. If you wish to change what model is used then edit the content of the "model.jl". 
Use addBound(lowerBound,upperBound) to add variables and variable bounds to be shrunk.
Use addConstraint(expression,inequality or equality sign string,right hand side) to add constraints.
All addBound()s must appear before the addConstraint()s and the expressions in addConstraint() can only include variables
Defined by the addBound()s. The expressions cannot be trigonometric, logarithmic or polynomials of degree higher than two.
